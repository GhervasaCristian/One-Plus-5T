# One-Plus-5T
The old Camera M module for One Plus 5T was obsolete and incompatible with newer versions of magisk. This one it was reported for compatibility in current versions. Last tested magisk version is v24.3
This is not made by me, is just a port for better compatibility. Credits go to txx1219/DorianX, ported by gherv1 to Magisk 20.4+.
